<h1>The Application</h1>
<h1>Joseph Mulraney 15517783</h1>
<p> The application allows for DVDs to be bought and sold. There is an admin login: username=admin password=admin
<br>If the password or email is entered incorrectly an error message will appear. If not it beings the user
to the home screen, here it is possible to register and ad, search the item library and place bids, the user can also
log in to another account or register another account.
<br>The applicaiton uses an Ajax method to update the library when searching for specific items, and when validating the 
login info
<br>The session has two attributes, the most important one being the user id, this is useful when registering a new item
<br> as it gets the seller identity through the session. This is used as a foreign key between the
<br> item and user tables.
